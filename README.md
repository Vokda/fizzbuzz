# FIZZBUZZ

This repo contains multiple little programs that run the fizzbuzz algorithm.

Fizzbuzz is an algorithm that for each number 1 to 100 print the number unless it is divisible by 3 or 5.
If it is divisible by 3 print fizz.
If it is divisible by 5 print buzz.
if it is divisible by both print fizzbuzz.

## Why fizzbuzz?

It is a very simple algorithm to write. 
In case of a new language it is a suitable beginner assignment. 
In case of a well known language it should be trivial enough to try novel solutions.

# How to run

Simply run the script run\_fizz\_buzzes.sh. 
It will compile all the code, run the programs and check for correctness.
